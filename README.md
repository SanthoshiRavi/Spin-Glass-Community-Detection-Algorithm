## Introduction

Community detection is a fundamental problem in network science. The Spin Glass Algorithm, inspired by statistical physics, is an effective method for identifying densely connected subgroups within a network. This repository provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm, a solved example problem, and a Python implementation.

## Solved Example Problem

The PDF document contains a step-by-step solution to a community detection problem using the Spin Glass Algorithm. The problem considers a specific graph structure, initial spins, temperature, and probability threshold. The document walks through 5 iterations, showing how communities are identified.

## Concepts of Spin Glass Detection Algorithm

The PowerPoint presentation explains the key concepts of the Spin Glass Detection Algorithm, including:

- Definition and importance of community detection.
- The Spin Glass model and Hamiltonian.
- Algorithm steps: initialization, Hamiltonian calculation, spin flipping, and convergence.
- Examples and visualizations.

## Python Implementation

The repository includes a Python script implementing the Spin Glass Algorithm. The implementation details:

- Graph creation using `igraph`.
- Initial spin configuration and Hamiltonian calculation.
- Iterative process with spin flipping and energy updates.
- Visualization of the graph at each iteration.

## Google Colab Output

The document contains the output from running the Python implementation in Google Colab. It shows the step-by-step iterations, node flipping, changes in Hamiltonian, and visualizations of the graph.
